I. INTRODUCTION

MODERN security threats require adaptive defense mechanisms capable of responding to evolving attack vectors. Traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems often fail to identify novel attacks and lack automated response capabilities. Our reinforcement learning approach using Deep Q-Networks addresses these limitations by learning optimal response policies through interaction with the environment.

This paper presents a thorough evaluation of our DQN-based Windows IDS, focusing on detection accuracy, response appropriateness, system impact, and real-world performance. We compare our approach against traditional methods including signature-based systems, anomaly detection, and other machine learning techniques.

IX. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

   Based on our evaluation, we have identified several areas for future improvement:

   1) Zero-day Detection: Enhance generalization to previously unseen attack patterns through techniques such as self-supervised learning and anomaly detection integration.
   
   2) Faster Convergence: Implement prioritized experience replay to accelerate learning by focusing on the most informative experiences.
   
   3) Resource Optimization: Reduce memory footprint during peak detection periods through model compression techniques.
   
   4) Cooperative Defense: Implement agent communication across network endpoints to enable coordinated responses to distributed attacks.
   
   5) Explainability: Develop better visualization of decision-making processes to build trust and enable security analyst oversight.

X. CONCLUSION

   Our DQN-based Windows IDS demonstrates strong performance across most metrics, particularly excelling in detection accuracy and appropriate response selection. The system shows robust performance with acceptable system impact, making it viable for real-world deployment.
   
   The comparative analysis confirms that our reinforcement learning approach offers advantages over traditional methods, particularly in adapting to new threats and automating responses. While the signature-based approach remains more efficient in terms of system resource usage, our DQN approach provides significantly better detection capabilities.
   
   The primary areas for improvement include zero-day attack detection and resource optimization during peak loads. Future work will focus on these areas while maintaining the current strengths in detection accuracy and response appropriateness.
