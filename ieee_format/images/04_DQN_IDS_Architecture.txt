CAPTION:
"Fig. 4. System architecture diagram showing the integration of the DQN agent with Windows event sources, feature extraction pipeline, response execution components, and alert systems. Data flows from Windows security events through preprocessing to the DQN core, which selects appropriate responses based on learned policies. The system includes feedback loops for continuous learning and adaptation."
