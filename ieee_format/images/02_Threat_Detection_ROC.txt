THREAT DETECTION ROC CURVE IMAGE SPECIFICATION

TITLE: "Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves for Windows IDS"

DESCRIPTION:
A multi-curve ROC plot showing the detection performance of the DQN-based IDS across different attack categories, with comparison to baseline methods.

X-AXIS: False Positive Rate (0 to 1.0)
Y-AXIS: True Positive Rate (0 to 1.0)

PLOT ELEMENTS:
- Reference diagonal line (dotted gray): Represents random classifier performance
- DQN overall performance curve (bold blue): AUC = 0.967
- Attack-specific curves:
  * Brute Force attacks (green): AUC = 0.988
  * Privilege Escalation (orange): AUC = 0.923
  * Data Exfiltration (purple): AUC = 0.945
  * Lateral Movement (yellow): AUC = 0.907
  * Command & Control (red): AUC = 0.961
  * Zero-day Simulations (dashed black): AUC = 0.843
- Comparison methods (thinner lines):
  * Signature-based (gray): AUC = 0.897
  * Anomaly Detection (light blue): AUC = 0.931
  * Random Forest (brown): AUC = 0.941
  * LSTM Network (pink): AUC = 0.952

KEY POINTS TO MARK:
1. Operating point of DQN system (circle marker): FPR = 0.028, TPR = 0.935
2. Optimal threshold point (star marker): FPR = 0.031, TPR = 0.942

LEGEND:
Place in bottom-right corner, showing all curves with AUC values

COLOR SCHEME:
- Background: White
- Grid lines: Light gray
- Curves: As specified above
- Important thresholds: Vertical dashed lines at FPR = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1

CAPTION:
"Fig. 2. ROC curves for the DQN-based Windows IDS showing detection performance across different attack categories. The overall AUC of 0.967 indicates excellent discrimination ability. Brute Force and Command & Control attacks show the best detection characteristics, while Zero-day attacks present the greatest challenge. The DQN approach outperforms traditional methods for all attack categories except highly predictable signature-based detection of known Brute Force attacks."
