IV. ALERT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The alert system is a critical component of our Windows IDS, providing timely notifications through multiple channels while preventing alert fatigue through intelligent prioritization. This section details the architecture and functionality of our multi-channel notification framework.

A. Alert Classification and Prioritization

   All detected threats are classified into four severity levels based on their potential impact and confidence score:
   
   1) Critical: Immediate threats with high confidence of severe system compromise (score: 8.5-10.0)
   2) High: Significant threats with substantial potential impact (score: 6.5-8.4)
   3) Medium: Moderate threats requiring attention (score: 4.0-6.4)
   4) Low: Minor or potential threats with limited impact (score: 0.0-3.9)

   The classification algorithm considers:
   - Attack vector and exploitation difficulty
   - Affected system components and their criticality
   - Potential for lateral movement
   - Data sensitivity in targeted resources
   - Detection confidence score from the DQN model

B. Application Alert Subsystem

   The application alert subsystem provides immediate, context-aware notifications through:
   
   1) Windows Action Center Integration: System-level notifications with appropriate urgency flags
   
   2) Security Dashboard: A real-time threat visualization interface with:
      - Threat timeline with attack progression indicators
      - Affected resource mapping and relationship visualization
      - Automated response tracking
      - One-click manual intervention options
   
   3) Contextual Alert Suppression: Intelligently groups related alerts to prevent notification flooding:
      - Temporal correlation of similar events (within 120-second window)
      - Spatial correlation (same source/target)
      - Attack chain recognition and unified presentation
   
   4) User Presence Detection: Adjusts notification visibility based on:
      - User activity detection
      - Work hours configuration
      - Device lock state
      - Alert priority level

C. Email Alert Subsystem

   The email alerting component delivers notifications to security personnel and system administrators with:
   
   1) Priority-Based Delivery:
      - Critical: Immediate delivery with follow-up mechanisms
      - High: Immediate delivery
      - Medium: Batched hourly during business hours
      - Low: Daily digest format
   
   2) Format Optimization:
      - Mobile-responsive templates
      - Security summary cards
      - Embedded response actions
      - Threat intelligence context
   
   3) Delivery Confirmation:
      - Read receipts tracking
      - Escalation for unacknowledged critical alerts
      - Fallback notification paths
   
   4) Administrative Controls:
      - Recipient group management
      - Schedule customization
      - Threshold adjustments
      - Alert suppression rules

D. Security Response Integration

   Alerts are tightly coupled with the system's response capabilities:
   
   1) Automated Response Actions: Based on threat classification, the system can automatically initiate:
      - Network isolation of compromised hosts
      - Process termination and binary quarantine
      - User account lockdown or privilege reduction
      - Firewall rule deployment
      - Registry modification rollback
   
   2) Interactive Response Options: Alerts contain actionable elements enabling responders to:
      - Approve recommended actions
      - Select alternative responses
      - Delegate to specialized teams
      - Add case notes and context
   
   3) Incident Tracking:
      - Unique identifier assignment
      - Response action audit trail
      - Time-to-resolution metrics
      - Integration with ticketing systems

E. Alert System Performance

   The alert system was evaluated on several key metrics:

      - Structured event data for automated parsing
      - Correlation with native security events
   
   2) Windows Defender ATP API:
      - Bi-directional threat intelligence sharing
      - Confirmation of detection through secondary validation
      - Response action coordination
   
   3) Active Directory Integration:
      - Security group-based alert routing
      - User context enhancement for alerts
      - Authentication anomaly correlation

G. User Experience Considerations

   The alert system design prioritizes usability through:
   
   1) Alert Fatigue Mitigation:
      - Dynamic thresholds based on baseline activity
      - User feedback incorporation
      - Machine learning-based alert optimization
   
   2) Accessibility:
      - Multi-modal notifications (visual, audio, email)
      - High-contrast alert interfaces
      - Screen reader compatibility
   
   3) Internationalization:
      - Language detection and translation
      - Locale-specific formatting
      - Time zone awareness

This comprehensive alert system ensures that security personnel receive timely, actionable notifications while minimizing disruptions from false or low-priority alerts. The integration with automated response capabilities enables rapid mitigation of threats, often without requiring human intervention for well-understood attack patterns.
