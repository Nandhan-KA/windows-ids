DEEP Q-NETWORK APPROACH FOR WINDOWS INTRUSION 
DETECTION SYSTEMS: EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS

Abstract—This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of our Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach for Windows Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The evaluation covers detection accuracy, response effectiveness, system impact, and real-world applicability. Our approach demonstrates 94.3% overall accuracy with a 2.8% false positive rate and 92.6% F1 score. Compared to traditional methods, the DQN approach shows superior detection capabilities for various attack types while maintaining acceptable system resource utilization. This evaluation confirms the viability of reinforcement learning techniques for adaptive intrusion detection in Windows environments. The DQN-based approach enables dynamic response selection, which significantly improves the system's ability to mitigate attacks in their early stages while minimizing impact on legitimate system operations.

I. INTRODUCTION

MODERN security threats require adaptive defense mechanisms capable of responding to evolving attack vectors. Traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems often fail to identify novel attacks and lack automated response capabilities. Our reinforcement learning approach using Deep Q-Networks addresses these limitations by learning optimal response policies through interaction with the environment.

Windows operating systems present unique security challenges due to their complex architecture, diverse user base, and widespread enterprise adoption. Traditional security approaches rely heavily on signature matching and static rule sets, which are increasingly ineffective against sophisticated attacks that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities, living-off-the-land techniques, and polymorphic malware.

This paper presents a thorough evaluation of our DQN-based Windows IDS, focusing on detection accuracy, response appropriateness, system impact, and real-world performance. We demonstrate how reinforcement learning can significantly enhance intrusion detection capabilities by enabling:

1) Adaptive response selection based on evolving threat scenarios
2) Early detection of attack patterns before significant system compromise
3) Balanced countermeasure application that minimizes impact on legitimate operations
4) Continuous learning from new attack vectors and defense outcomes

II. MODULES

A. Reinforcement Learning Environment
   The foundation of our approach is a well-defined reinforcement learning environment that models the Windows security domain. This environment consists of:

   1) State Space: A comprehensive representation of the system's security status incorporating event logs, network traffic, system metrics, process behavior, user activity, file system operations, and registry modifications. Each state vector contains 248 features extracted from these data sources, normalized and preprocessed to facilitate neural network training.

   2) Action Space: A set of 18 defensive actions the agent can take, including:
      - Network-level responses (IP blocking, rate limiting, DNS sinkholing)
      - Process-level responses (process termination, sandboxing, privilege reduction)
      - System-level responses (patch application, configuration changes)
      - User-level responses (forced authentication, access restriction)
      - Alerting and logging actions with varying severity levels

   3) Reward Function: A composite function that rewards:
      - Successful attack detection and mitigation
      - Minimal impact on legitimate operations
      - Timeliness of response actions
      - Resource efficiency

   4) Transition Function: Models how system states change in response to both agent actions and attacker activities, incorporating realistic Windows system dynamics.

B. Training Module
   The training module implements Deep Q-Learning with several enhancements:

   1) Curriculum Learning: Progressive exposure to attack scenarios of increasing complexity:
      - Phase 1: Single-vector, well-known attack patterns
      - Phase 2: Multi-vector attacks with common techniques
      - Phase 3: Sophisticated attack chains with evasion attempts
      - Phase 4: Zero-day simulation with previously unseen patterns

   2) Experience Replay: A memory buffer of 100,000 experiences (state, action, reward, next state tuples) sampled during training to break correlations between consecutive samples and improve convergence.

   3) Target Network: A separate target Q-network updated every 10,000 steps to reduce oscillations during training.

   4) Exploration Strategy: Epsilon-greedy policy with scheduled annealing from 1.0 to 0.05 over 15,000 episodes.

   5) Adversarial Training: Incorporation of a red-team component that continuously evolves attack strategies to challenge the defensive agent.

C. Threat Detection Module
   The threat detection module processes the state vector to identify potential security incidents:

   1) Feature Extraction: Converts raw Windows event logs, network packets, system metrics, and other data sources into a normalized feature vector suitable for neural network processing.

   2) Anomaly Scoring: Calculates deviation scores for observed behavior against baseline profiles established during training.

   3) Pattern Recognition: Identifies known attack signatures and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on feature combinations.

   4) Context Integration: Incorporates system context (time of day, user role, resource sensitivity) to enhance detection accuracy.

   5) Confidence Estimation: Provides confidence scores for each detection to inform response selection.

III. ALGORITHM

A. Deep Q-Network Architecture
   Our DQN implementation uses a neural network architecture with:

   1) Input Layer: 248 nodes (one per state feature)
   2) Hidden Layers: Four fully connected layers with 512, 256, 128, and 64 nodes respectively
   3) Output Layer: 18 nodes (one per possible action)
   4) Activation Functions: ReLU for hidden layers, linear for output layer
   5) Optimization: Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0001
   6) Loss Function: Mean Squared Error between predicted Q-values and target Q-values

B. Q-Learning Update Formula
   The core of our approach is the Q-learning update rule, enhanced for deep neural networks:

   Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max_a'Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

   Where:
   - Q(s,a) is the estimated Q-value for state s and action a
   - α is the learning rate (0.0001 in our implementation)
   - r is the immediate reward
   - γ is the discount factor (0.99 in our implementation)
   - max_a'Q(s',a') is the maximum estimated Q-value for the next state s'

C. DQN Algorithm with Double Q-Learning
   To reduce overestimation bias, we implement Double Q-learning:

   1) Maintain two networks: online network Q and target network Q'
   2) Use online network for action selection: a* = argmax_a Q(s',a)
   3) Use target network for value estimation: Q'(s',a*)
   4) Update target: y = r + γQ'(s',a*)
   5) Minimize loss: L = (Q(s,a) - y)²
   6) Update target network parameters (θ') periodically:
      θ' ← τθ + (1-τ)θ', where τ = 0.001

D. Prioritized Experience Replay
   To focus learning on important transitions, we implement prioritized experience replay:

   1) Priority calculation: p_i = |δ_i| + ε
      Where δ_i is the TD error: δ_i = r + γ·max_a'Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)
      And ε is a small positive constant (0.01)

   2) Sampling probability: P(i) = p_i^α / Σ_k p_k^α
      Where α determines how much prioritization is used (0.6 in our implementation)

   3) Importance-sampling weight: w_i = (N·P(i))^-β
      Where N is the replay buffer size and β is annealed from 0.4 to 1.0

E. Reward Function Formula
   Our composite reward function is defined as:

   R(s,a,s') = w_d·R_detection + w_r·R_response + w_i·R_impact + w_t·R_time

   Where:
   - R_detection = accuracy_score - false_positive_penalty
   - R_response = appropriateness_score - overreaction_penalty
   - R_impact = 1 - normalized_system_impact
   - R_time = early_detection_bonus - response_delay_penalty
   - w_d, w_r, w_i, w_t are weights (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 respectively)

VI. CONCLUSION

Our DQN-based Windows IDS demonstrates strong performance across most metrics, particularly excelling in detection accuracy and appropriate response selection. The system shows robust performance with acceptable system impact, making it viable for real-world deployment.

The experimental results confirm several key advantages of our approach:

1) Adaptive response selection provides a significant improvement over static rule-based systems, with 87.6% appropriate response rate compared to estimated 63% for traditional systems.

2) The reinforcement learning framework enables the system to continually improve through operational experience, as demonstrated by the increasing reward trend during training and the 79.8% maintained performance under concept drift conditions.

3) The balance between detection accuracy (94.3%) and false positive rate (2.8%) represents a substantial improvement over comparable approaches, particularly for zero-day attack scenarios where our system maintained 76.0% F1 score.

4) Resource utilization remains within acceptable limits for enterprise deployment, with peak CPU usage of 15.7% and average memory consumption of 374 MB.

The comparative analysis confirms that our reinforcement learning approach offers advantages over traditional methods, particularly in adapting to new threats and automating responses. While the signature-based approach remains more efficient in terms of system resource usage, our DQN approach provides significantly better detection capabilities.

The primary areas for improvement include zero-day attack detection and resource optimization during peak loads. Future work will focus on these areas while maintaining the current strengths in detection accuracy and response appropriateness.
