DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR ADAPTIVE WINDOWS INTRUSION DETECTION: 
A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH

Abstract—This paper presents an adaptive Windows Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and neural network architectures for real-time threat detection and response. Our system employs a four-layer neural network model (512-256-128-64 nodes) trained through reinforcement learning to recognize attack patterns and autonomously select appropriate countermeasures from 18 defensive actions. The system achieves 94.3% detection accuracy with only a 2.8% false positive rate across diverse attack vectors including brute force attempts, privilege escalation, and zero-day exploits. Key innovations include a multi-channel alerting framework that generates contextual app notifications, prioritized email alerts, and system security bulletins based on threat severity and user-configurable thresholds. The email alerting subsystem implements classification-based prioritization, sending immediate notifications for critical threats while batching lower-priority alerts. Integration with Windows security infrastructure enables automatic execution of defensive measures, including network isolation, process termination, and account lockdown. Real-world deployment over a two-week period demonstrated 427 correctly identified threats with 412 automatically mitigated incidents, requiring human intervention in only 15 cases. The system's resource utilization remains minimal (7.8% average CPU usage, 374MB memory) while achieving an 83.5% early detection rate for attacks before significant impact. Comparative analysis shows our approach outperforms traditional signature-based methods and other machine learning techniques in accuracy and adaptability, particularly for novel attack detection. This implementation demonstrates that neural network-based reinforcement learning provides an effective foundation for next-generation security systems capable of autonomous threat response while maintaining robust user notification channels.
