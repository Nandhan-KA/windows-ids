# Reinforcement Learning Environment for Windows IDS

## Environment Design

Our Windows Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is formulated as a reinforcement learning environment where an agent learns to detect and respond to potential intrusions by interacting with the system.

### State Space

The state space `S` consists of features extracted from the Windows operating system, capturing the current security context:

- **Event Log Features**: Patterns in security, system, and application logs
- **Network Features**: Connection statistics, packet characteristics, and traffic patterns
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage, and other performance indicators
- **Process Information**: Running processes, their relationships, and resource usage
- **User Activity**: Login patterns, command histories, and privilege escalations
- **File System Activity**: Creation, modification, and access patterns of sensitive files
- **Registry Activity**: Changes to critical registry keys

These features are preprocessed and normalized to form a state vector that represents the current security posture of the system.

### Action Space

The action space `A` includes various defensive measures that can be taken by the IDS:

1. **No Action**: Continue monitoring without intervention
2. **Block IP**: Block an IP address at the firewall level
3. **Apply Rate Limiting**: Throttle connections from suspicious sources
4. **Redirect to Honeypot**: Divert suspicious traffic to a controlled environment
5. **Generate Alert**: Notify security personnel for manual investigation
6. **Increase Monitoring**: Apply more intensive monitoring for specific components
7. **Block Port**: Close specific network ports
8. **Block Protocol**: Disable specific network protocols

Each action has different costs, effectiveness, and potential for false positives.

## Reward System

The reward function `R(s, a, s')` is designed to encourage effective intrusion detection while minimizing false positives and operational impact.

### Reward Components

1. **Detection Reward (Rd)**:
   - +10 for correctly identifying an actual intrusion
   - -5 for false positives (incorrectly identifying normal activity as intrusion)
   - -2 for false negatives (missing an actual intrusion)

2. **Response Appropriateness Reward (Ra)**:
   - +5 for selecting an action proportional to the threat level
   - -3 for overreacting (e.g., blocking an IP for a minor anomaly)
   - -1 for underreacting (e.g., only generating an alert for a major attack)

3. **System Impact Reward (Rs)**:
   - -0.1 × (percentage of system resources used by the defensive action)
   - -0.2 × (number of legitimate operations blocked)

4. **Time Efficiency Reward (Rt)**:
   - +3 for early detection of attack sequences
   - -0.1 × (time taken to respond to an intrusion attempt)

### Composite Reward Function

The total reward at each step is calculated as:

R(s, a, s') = w₁·Rd + w₂·Ra + w₃·Rs + w₄·Rt

Where:
- w₁ = 1.0 (weight for detection accuracy)
- w₂ = 0.8 (weight for response appropriateness)
- w₃ = 0.5 (weight for system impact)
- w₄ = 0.7 (weight for time efficiency)

These weights can be adjusted based on the specific security priorities of the deployment environment.

## Episode Structure

Episodes in our RL environment are structured as follows:

1. **Episode Start**: Begins with the system in a normal state or at the beginning of a simulated attack sequence.

2. **Episode Progression**: The agent observes the state, selects an action, and receives a reward. The state transitions to the next state based on:
   - The effects of the agent's action
   - The progression of normal system activities
   - The progression of any attack sequence (if present)

3. **Episode Termination**: Episodes end when:
   - A simulated attack is successfully mitigated
   - A simulated attack succeeds despite defense measures
   - A predetermined number of steps is reached
   - System resources fall below a critical threshold due to defensive actions

## Training Data Generation

Training data is generated from a combination of:

1. **Real-world Security Logs**: Sanitized Windows event logs from actual environments
2. **Simulated Attack Sequences**: Controlled execution of common attack patterns
3. **Normal Activity Patterns**: Baseline behavior of Windows systems under typical usage
4. **Synthetic Data Augmentation**: Generated variants of known attack patterns

## Training Process

1. **Initial Exploration Phase**: The agent explores the environment with a high exploration rate (ε = 1.0)
2. **Gradual Exploitation**: As training progresses, the exploration rate decays to focus on exploiting learned knowledge
3. **Curriculum Learning**: Training starts with simple attack patterns and progressively moves to more complex scenarios
4. **Adversarial Training**: The attack simulation is periodically updated to incorporate evasion techniques that the agent has learned to detect

## Performance Evaluation

The agent's performance is evaluated using:

1. **Detection Metrics**: 
   - True Positive Rate (TPR)
   - False Positive Rate (FPR)
   - Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
   - Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

2. **Operational Metrics**:
   - Average response time
   - System resource overhead
   - Legitimate activity disruption rate

3. **Resistance to Evasion**:
   - Performance against novel attack patterns
   - Adaptation to changing attack techniques
